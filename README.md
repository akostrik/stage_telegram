# Internship Master II, Sorbonne University (Paris)
An Internship of 5 months, from the 3 April 2023 to the 12 September 2023

## The missions of the internship
- Complete my education by a full-time profesional pratice in a Paris association
- Acquire a first professional experience as a developement ingineer
- Determine the initial orientation of my career, in particular computer sciences applied to the social life
- Acquire new knowledge, techniques, approaches, methods, mÃ©thodes, toolsls, etc, in practice
- Acquire know-how and the code of four associations
- Evaluate my capacity of integration in the professional environment
- And so, ensure my entrance to the work market

## What the appication can do
1) Real time verification of Telegram messages veracity by two methods:
- Looking for the marks of the propaganda in every separate message via OpenAI
- Comparison of the information diffused by several channels via OpenAI in order to detect similar channels
2) Constant improvement of the results by the mean of attaching of examples corriged by a user to OpenAI requests (Learning service)

### The easy scheme of the appication (except Learning service)

### The same scheme of the appication in the programmer style

### The same scheme of the appication in English
1) Server 2 gets, from the user, the names of Telegram channels to exminate 
2) Server 1 listens to the chosen channels
3) Server 1 treats every new message :
- estimates the marks of the propaganda of the message via OpenAI
- basing on these marks of the propaganda calculates the trust coefficient of the message 
- extracts the principal information of the new message, in the form of several affirmations, via OpenAI
- compares these affirmations to the recent affirmations of the other followed channels
- stocks all obteined information in the database (the message itself, the result if its analisys, updates the trust coefficients of the channels, updates the measure of similarity of the channels)
4) Server 2 constantly returns the current resuls of the analysis to the server vue.js
5) vue.js displays the results for the user in the form of a graph of the channels, where every summit contains the id of the channel and its trust coefficient, and every edge is the measure of similarity of two channels

Simultaneously to all these, Server 2 accomplishes the learning service:
1) The user corrects the previous responses of OpenAI
2) Server 1 attaches these corrected examples to every new OpenAI request   

### The same scheme of the appication in English with all the technical details
See [server 1 README](https://github.com/akostrik/stage_telegram/tree/main/server1) and [server 2 README](https://github.com/akostrik/stage_telegram/tree/main/server1)

### The same scheme of the appication in programming languages
See [server 1 code in python](https://github.com/akostrik/stage_telegram/tree/main/server1), [server 2 code in node.js](https://github.com/akostrik/stage_telegram/tree/main/server2/backend/server.js) and [the user interface code in vue.js](https://github.com/akostrik/stage_telegram/tree/main/server2/src)

## Setup and configuration
### Database MongoDB Atlas configuration (in the cloud)
[Create a MongoDB account](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) 

In your account, create database by the name 'telegram'

Import the collection 'characteristics' from the file characteristics.json to your mongo database 'telegram':

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/import/mongoimport/

```
sudo mongoimport --db telegram --collection characteristics --file collection_characteristics.json
```

Go [here](https://cloud.mongodb.com) - Database Deployments - to add your current ip adresse

Go [here](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) - Database - Connect - Drives - to get you MonogDB connection string 

In the line 13 of server2/backend/server2.js put the same MongoDB connection string as in server1/.env:
> const mongoUrl = '...';

### OpenAI Configuration 

[Get your OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

Your account should have acces to gpt-4 (a paying option)

### Telegram Configuration  

[Get Telegram credentials api_id and api_hash ](https://my.telegram.org/auth)

During the first launching of the application, enter the phone number of your Telegram account and then enter the confirmation code

#### Create the file "server1/.env" 
```
API_ID=...
API_HASH=...
OPENAI=...
MONGO=...
```
MONGO = your MonogDB connection string

OPENAI = OpenAI key

API_ID and API_HASH = Telegram credentials

### Server 1 setup
Install python version >= 3.7.1

Install the libraries :
```
pip3 install telethon
```
```
pip install DateTime
```
```
npm i dotenv
```
```
pip install requests
```
```
pip install pymongo
```
```
pip install --upgrade openai
```

### Server 1 compile and run
In the first terminal launch server1
```
server1/python server1.py
```

### Server 2 setup
```
npm install
```
### Server 2 compile and run
In the second terminal launch Vue server:
```
cd server2
npm run dev
```
In the third terminal launch server2:
```
node server2/backend/server2.js
```
## User interface (vue.js)
After having installed and configured all noted above, go to [here](http://localhost:5173/) to enjoy the service

## The limits of the application
- only for Linux
- MongoDB free size is limited to ... Mg
- OpenQI reauires payment
- You can use MongoDB installed locally

## PS
For technilcal details of server1 and server2, see README files in the corresponding folders.
