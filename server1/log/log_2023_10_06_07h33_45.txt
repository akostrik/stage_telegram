            Please generate binary affirmations from the provided news message:

            'В Кремле пообещали, что выступление Путина на «Валдае» станет** событием мирового масштаба**'

            For each affirmation:

            1. Extract key assertions from the message. 
            2. Convert negations into their positive counterparts.
            3. Each affirmation must be standalone and provide full context. If there's an attributed source in the message, ensure it's included in the affirmation.
            4. Provide a truth value for each affirmation based on its accuracy within the message.

            The result should be in this format:
            {
                'Binary affirmation 1': true/false,
                'Binary affirmation 2': true/false,
                ...
            }

            Ensure that each binary affirmation is concise, clear, and independent. They should almost function as a unique hash of the information they contain.

            For example. Here I provide examples already checked by gpt-4, with corrections = result that should appear instead, or close to it. You need understand what I mean with these examples and strictly follow :

Message: В Кремле 
Affirmations: {'The Kremlin has promised something regarding Putin\'s performance at "Valdai"': True}
Corrected Affirmations: {'The Kremlin has promised something regarding Putin\'s performance at "Valdai"': 'false'}
Put to mongo successful.
