## Server 1 technical details
Python is choosen for the server 1, because:
- it is well adapted to [data science projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) because of its [specilised libraries](https://datascientest.com/top-10-des-librairies-python-pour-un-data-scientist)
- it is a rather easy language, partly because it frees the memory automatically

Every output of an execution is saved in the [logs](https://github.com/akostrik/stage_telegram/tree/main/server1/log)
